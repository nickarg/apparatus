# So you want to contribute? That's awesome :smiley:

## Option 1 Contribute directly to ASTo

ASTo is an application to support security analysis using the Apparatus security framework. If you use the Apparatus framework and want to add more features to the tool, that's great news.

1. Make a fork. Play around with the code.
2. Run `npm run lint` to make sure the code follows [Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) coding style.
3. Make a Pull request.
4. If your pull request introduces a new dependency, make a note of it in your commit.

## Option 2 You like the tool and want to use it for own methodology or framework.

ASTo was developed to support the Apparatus framework and I would prefer to keep it like that. Having said that ASTo was designed with modularity in mind. It is very easy to replace the Apparatus specific concepts with concepts from another modeling language.

I would be more than happy to help anyone with the necessary changes.

If ASTo generates enough interest from the community I would consider moving it to plugin based application. The core application will provide the basic logic of the app while different modeling languages and frameworks will function as plugins. The plugins would be responsible for imposing the languages rules and analysis functions.

1. Make a fork. Play around with code.
2. Read the apparatus [wiki](https://github.com/Or3stis/apparatus/wiki).
3. Experiment.
4. If you have any issues I would love to help.

Happy coding ðŸ˜‰
