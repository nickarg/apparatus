ASTo is security analysis tool for IoT networks. It is developed to support the Apparatus security framework. ASTo is based on
[electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and
[cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/).

The application is still in prototyping stage, which means a lot of
functionality is being added with each commit, along with massive changes in
almost everything.
